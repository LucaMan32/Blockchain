# Blockchain
Python code for understand the structure of a blockchain, made by Manfrin luca

This project is made for the course of Cryptography at the 'SSRI' course at Unimi.

It's made for showing graphically how it works a simple blockchain,
like transactions between two users, creation of new block, hash and more
other features that i'm constantly updating.
